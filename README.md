# ODE-CS
This repository to contains a set of simple, automatically generated C# bindings for the [Open Dynamics Engine](https://bitbucket.org/odedevs/ode). These bindings currently target version 0.14 of the library, and have been written to be as close to the C APIs as possible. This means that function calls require no marshalling, and the original documentation can be usually be used as a guide. As you'll often have to make use of unsafe code to use these bindings, it is recommended that you wrap these calls with more C# friendly methods when writing your game.
